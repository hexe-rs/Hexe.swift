    A Swift wrapper for the <a href="https://github.com/hexe-rs/Hexe">Hexe</a> chess engine

## What is Hexe?

Hexe is a pure [Rust] chess engine.

## What is This?

This is a cross-platform framework that serves to bring the majority of Hexe's functionality over to Swift.

Because Rust and Swift don't map one-to-one, this API may diverge slightly from the Rust API.
